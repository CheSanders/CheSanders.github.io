<h1> 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
One time management and productivity idea I learned about was the pomodoro technique. I really liked the idea of this technique. I have ADHD and was introduced to something similar, except it was every 10 minutes you take about a 2 minute break. The idea of taking a break is crucial and to know that there is technique for people without ADHD makes me feel a lot better about using these types of techniques. Time boxing is when a person or team strives to achieve a goal in a certain amount of time. When the time is up, the team or individual then evaluates their progress. We can use time boxing in Phase 0 by setting up specific hours for each assignment, and when the time is up, then we assess our progress. This can helpful because you can see what you can do to improve your focus during those hours. Currently, I manage time in a different way. I don't set up specific hours, instead I am always trying to complete my work if I'm not out with friends. For example, if I plan to go out at 8 p.m. I will spend the entire day from when I wake up trying to complete work. This has been effective for me because knowing that there is fun waiting for me after helps stimulate my brain. I do plan to employ time boxing because I believe that helps maximize efficiency. If you work too long sometimes you can get sloppy. Using the pomodoro technique will allow yourself to step back and take a deep breath. My overall plan in Phase 0 is to spend the majority of time working on the work that is assigned, while allowing myself to take frequent breaks. I will set up specific times during the week and use the time boxing technique as well, so I can maximize the efficiency of my work.

<h2> 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
	1) Shell is the program that takes your commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. Bash is a Unix shell and command language, which has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on Linux and OS X.

2) The most challenging thing for me going through this material was learning the "mv" command. I keep getting confused on which files are getting moved where. Everything else is fairly easy, but for some reason when it comes to moving a file or pushing a file into another I keep getting confused. I believe for these commands I need either watch more videos or see it visually in person. 

3) Yes, I have been able to successfully execute all of these commands. I went back to codecademy to try the "mv" command again. When I did redid the lesson it worked and seemed more straightforward. 

4) In my opinion, the most important commands are "pwd", "ls", "cd", "mkdir", "rmdir", and "touch". These are the most basic commands you must know to move around and understand the how to use the terminal. These commands pretty much show you what's in your computer, how to add files, and delete them. 

5)

pwd: Prints Working Directory 

ls: Lists all files in current Directory 

mv: Command that moves one or more files or directories from one place to another.

cd: Change directory 

../ is a directory 

touch: Creates a new empty file 

mkdir: Make a new directory

less: Allows you to view file

rmdir: Remove a directory

rm: Removes files or directory

help: Shows a short list of the commands built into the Bash shell itself

<h3> 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection 
	If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
First, I would tell them to create a new repository by clicking the add button in the top right corner of GitHub. In order to the fork the repository, you need to click the fork button, which is also located in the top right corner of GitHub. You then will copy the URL, which is located next to HTTPS on GitHub. In order to clone the repository, you will have to open up your terminal and type in 'git clone YOUR_COPIED_URL' (paste the URL).

You would fork a repository as opposed to creating a new one, because forking a repository allows you to work on someone else's original project. Forking a repository acts a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I didn't really have any struggles setting up git or GitHub, except I couldn't figure out how to open the cloned repository in Sublime Text from the terminal. I learned a ton in this process. I reinforced what I had already previously learned about Git and was able to gain more knowledge into forking & cloning repositories.
