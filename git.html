      Git is a version control software that lives locally on your computer. Git allows you to save different versions of your work, as well as create branches and in the end merge them together. Github is a version control software that lives remotely (similar to cloud). For example, you can work on one project with five team members. GitHub allows all five team members to access that project in real time and make changes. Version control is a software system consisting of many different versions, while keeping them well organized. GitHub helps with this by storing it remotely and allowing all team members of a project to access it in real time. No matter where the team members are or what time it is the team mates can access the project via GitHub.

       Developers use version control (git) because it's great way to stay organized. Developers are able to make changes to different parts of the code they are writing at the same time. For example, one team member can be working on the beginning part of the code, while the other team members is working on the end of the code. They can then use a git command to merge those changes together and both their changes will be saved. Developers are also able to create branches which are pretty much separate rough draft files. If they feel the new branch is perfect, then they can merge into the master branch.

       In summary, GitHub is a great place to store your code. As long as you have a computer and access to internet, you are able to access your code from whereever you are and whenever you want. It's a great way for mulitiple people to work on the project as well and stay organized. GitHub keeps your code organized and brings transparency to your teammates.
