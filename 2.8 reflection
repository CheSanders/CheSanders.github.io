-How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?

My wireframe was more complex than my actual site. Other than that, the wireframe was a good place to start.

-What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?

I learned how to write the language and use "<sections>" instead of "<div>". 

-Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?

Yes, my website looks pretty boring right now. I look forward to adding more life to it and making it look more like an actual website.
